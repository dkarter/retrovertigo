Sometimes your desktop gets cluttered with windows of different running applications which makes it difficult to concetrate on the task at hand. 

This can also come in handing when sharing your screen or presenting.

Fortunately macOS offers some shortcuts to remediate this common problem:

`⌘+h` - hide current window

`⌘+⌥+h` - hide all other windows

`⌃+⌘+f` - toggle full screen mode
