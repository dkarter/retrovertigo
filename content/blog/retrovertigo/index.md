# What's with the name?

Retrovertigo is a song by one of my favorite, and most eccentric bands out
there, [Mr. Bungle](https://mrbungle.com/). This song was released on the California album.

You can listen to it here:

According to internet legend the song was written in its totality by the band’s
bassist, Trevor Dunn. He had the following to say about the meaning of the song:

> "The state of mind was disillusionment with a world or society that values image and money over human life. While certain “retro” fashions and lifestyles are considered hip, the on-going tradition of human suffering continues. As the world progresses technologically, certain people value and emulate “the good ol' days”, while others are born into poverty never having progressed past the dark ages. The title “retrovertigo” is a term I came up with to describe my nausea regarding this phenomena. At the time I was living in SF where swing dancing was making a come-back, silicon valley was exploding, vintage clothes were expensive, and the notion that anything could be bought or sold–a soul, a tragedy, the end of the world—seemed viable"
